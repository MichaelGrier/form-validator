## Form Validator

A simple client side form validation. Will confirm that the username and password are an acceptable length, that the email address is valid, and that the password and confirm password fields match.

## What I Learned

- using CSS custom properties
- using trim() to remove excess whitespace from values
- using charAt() to target and manipulate specific characters
